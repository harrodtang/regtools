#  Clearing the Confusion: Unbalanced Class Data  

Many resources on machine learning (ML) classification problems
recommend that if one's dataset has unbalanced class sizes, one
should modify the data to have equal class counts.  Yet it is shown here
that this is both unnecessary and often harmful.

## Overview

Illustrations of the (perceived) problems and
offered remedies appear in numerous parts of the ML literature, ranging
from [Web tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/diving-deep-imbalanced-data)
to [the research literature](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-018-0151-6#Sec2).  Major packages, such as
[caret](https://cran.r-project.org/package=caret),
[parsnip](https://cran.r-project.org/package=parsnip),
and
[mlr3](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlr3), also offer remedies.


> All of these sources recommend that you artificially equalize the class
> counts in your data, via various resampling methods.
> Upon closer inspection, though, one sees that **this
> is generally inadvisable, indeed harmful,** for several reasons:

* Undersampling is clearly problematic:  Why throw away data?
**Discarding data weakens our ability to predict new cases.**

* The data may be unbalanced *for a reason*.  Thus the imbalance itself
is useful information, again resulting in reduced predictive power if
it is ignored.

* There are **principled alternatives to
resampling,** including an adjustment formula to be presented here.  (See also
[my book on regression, classification and ML](https://books.google.com/books?id=IHs2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=matloff&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwje9LbA5dLmAhVJsZ4KHTvdADIQ6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=matloff&f=false).)

In other words: 

> Resampling methods **are both harmful and unnecessay**.

## Motivating example:  Credit card fraud data

This is a 
[Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
Quoting from the Kaggle site,

> The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September
> 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that
> occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807
> transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class
> (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

Note the phrase, "highly unbalanced."

Due to privacy concerns, PCA has been used to replace most of the
features,  though two original features have been retained.

## Motivating example:  Optical letter recognition data

This is a well-known
[UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition).  Again quoting from the site:

> The objective is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white
> rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the
> English alphabet. The character images were based on 20 different fonts
> and each letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce
> a file of 20,000 unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into 16
> primitive numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts)
> which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0
> through 15. 

This dataset is close to balanced, with each letter appearing about 775
times.

## Key issue:  How were the data generated?

The examples above illustrate two important cases:

- The fraud data is *imbalanced*, but *naturally so*.  Assuming the
two-day data collection period was typical, the population class
probability for fraud will be about what we see in the data, 0.172%.

- The letters data is *balanced*, but only *artificially so*.  The
curator of the dataset wanted the data to have about the same number
of instances of each letter.  But in general English usage, letter occur
with quite different frequencies:

>   E          12.02%
<br>
>   T           9.10%
<br>
>   A           8.12%
<br>
>   O           7.68%
<br>
>   I           7.31%
<br>
>   N           6.95%
<br>
...
<br>
...
<br>
>   Q           0.11
<br>
>   J           0.10
<br>
>   Z           0.07

## What your ML algorithm is thinking

ML algorithms take your data literally.  Say you have a two-class
setting, for Classes 0 and 1.  If about 1/2 your data is Class 1, then
the algorithm, whether directly or indirectly, operates under the
assumption that the true population class probabilities are each about 0.5.

In the letter data, since the sampling was actually *designed* to have
about the same number of instances for each letter, the algorithm you
use will then assume the true probabilities of the letters are about
1/26 each.  We know that is false, as the above table shows.

So, if you do resampling to make your data balanced, you are fooling
your ML algorithm.  Though that conceivably could be done responsibly, it
may actually undermine your ability to predict new cases well.

## Note on terminology 

We refer to the class probabilities for given feature
values as *conditional class probabilities*.  The overall class probabilities,
e.g. the 0.000172 value above, are *unconditional class probabilities*.

Another key term is the *overall rate of correct classification*.  To
maximize that, we fit our model and -- say in the two-class case --
guess Class 1 if and only if its estimated conditional probability is
greater than 0.5.  This assumes, though, equal costs of the two types
of misclassification.

## Goals and perceptions of problems

As is often the case, clear, precise statements of problems and goals
are needed to come up with good, *effective* solutions.  Let's consider
the two datasets in turn.

It will be easier to discuss the second dataset first.

### Letter recognition data

Intuitively, if we ignore our knowledge of the class probabilities --
12.02% etc. --- we are reducing our predictive ability.

In an experiment in my book (updated here), I sampled from the dataset
according to the realistic frequencies above, thus producing realistic
data.  I then fit a logistic model to a training set of 14,000, and used
it to predict a test set of 6,000, producing 6,000 conditional
probabilities for each letter.  Finally, I predicted the 6,000 letters,
first without applying the adjustment formula to those probabilities and
then with it.

Without the adjustment formula, I got a **correct classification
rate of 69%.**  But then using the formula, **the correct
classification rate rose to 76%.**

One can actually do much better on this dataset, either by adding
quadratic terms to the logit model, or by using a nonparametric method.
(In my book, I get 97% accuracy using random forests.)  But that is not
the point; instead, the point is that for any given ML algorithm on
balanced data, **we can do better by using the adjustment formula** (if,
of course, the correct class probabilities are known).

As you can see, **balanced data can be our enemy**.

In the above example, we obtained a modest but certainly valued
improvement in prediction accuracy.  In that data, the features actually
have rather strong predictive power, but the gain in accuracy would be
even larger on data with weaker features.

Consider for instance a balanced 2-class setting in which the features
have almost no predictive power, with true class probabilities 0.75 and 0.25.
Then (aside from overfitting issues), our correct classification rate
would be 50% from the balanced data but would jump to 75% with the
adjustment formula.

### Credit card fraud data

In the credit card fraud data, the perceived problem is that, if we use
the data to classify new cases, the extreme imbalance in the data wll
mean that we will always guess that the new case is not fraudulent.

With this approach, we'd miss all the fraudulent cases.  There aren't
many of them, but even the small number of cases can cause big damage,
so it is definitely an important issue.  Yet **the solution is not to
force the data to be balanced.** 

Instead, we *could* formally assign loss values to the two kinds of error,
i.e. false positives and false negatives, from the fraud point of view.
*But it's much easier to take an informal approach:*  We simply calculate
the conditional probabilities of the classes, given the features, and
have our code flag any that are above a threshhold we specify.
(Actually, `mlr3` does mention something similar to this as an alternative
to artificially balancing the data.)

In the credit card fraud case, we may decide, say, to flag any transaction
with at least a 25% chance of being fraudulent.  We could then check
these further by hand.

The code would look like this
(using the same data to fit and predict, just an illustration):

``` r

> glmout <- glm(Class ~ .,data=ccf,family=binomial)
> condprobs <- predict(glmout,ccf,type='response')
> tocheck <- which(condprobs > 0.25)
> names(tocheck) <- NULL
> head(tocheck)
[1]  542 6109 6332 6335 6337 6339

```

So we'd check cases 542, 6109 and so on by hand.

For the `randomForest` package, a bit more work (could write a wrapper
for it):

``` r

> ccf$Class <- as.factor(ccf$Class)
> rfout <- randomForest(Class ~ .,data=ccf)
> predout <- predict(rfout,ccf,type='response')
> treeguesses <- predout$individual  # class guesses for each tree
> tgs <- as.matrix(treeguesses)
# tgs[i,] has guesses for case i, '1's and '0's, from each tree
> probs <- apply(tgs,1,function(rw) mean(as.numeric(rw)))
> tocheck <- which(probs > 0.25)
> head(tocheck)
[1]   70  542  624 1747 4921 6109

```

Other ML algorithms/packages are similar.  E.g. for boosting, say with
the `gbm` package, the procedure is similar to that of `glm()` above.

For neural networks, e.g.  with the `neuralnet` package, call
`compute()` then take the `net.result` component.

Actually, both `caret` and `mlr3` allow one to extract probabilities in
this manner.  But again, this should be done instead of forcing balance,
which is recommended by those packages.

## The adjustment formula

For now, we'll assume the two-class setting here, with Class 0
and Class 1. This is the code for adjustment:

``` r

classadjust <- function(condprobs,wrongprob1,trueprob1) {
   wrongratio <- (1-wrongprob1) / wrongprob1
   fratios <- (1 / condprobs - 1) * (1 / wrongratio)
   trueratio <- (1-trueprob1) / trueprob1
   1 / (1 + trueratio * fratios)
}

```

where 

- `condprobs` is the vector of conditional class probabilities for
  the new cases, reported by the software

- `wrongratio` is the ratio of the numbers of Class 0 to Class 1
  datapoints in our dataset

- `trueratio` is the actual such ratio 

The return value is the set of adjusted conditional class  probabilities
for the new cases.

For instance, suppose we are in a setting in which there are equal
numbers of the two classes in our dataset, yet we know the true
(unconditional) class probabilities are 0.2 and 0.8 for Classes 0 and 1.
Then `wrongratio` would be 0.5/0.5 = 1.0, and `trueratio` would be
0.2/0.8 = 0.25. 

Use of this procedure is an option in my `regtools` package.

# The case of balanced data but unknown true class probabilities

What if the data are balanced but the true unconditional class
probabilities are unknown?  Other than creating various scenarios
involving the true values and exploring the results, there is not much
that we can do.  In essence, the result is a maximum-likelihood kind of
situation:  Our predicted class will be the one whose (nominal)
conditional probability makes our feature data most likely given the
class (see Appendix below), **which is very different from the question
we want to ask, Which class is most likely given the feature set?** 
We'll get answers ("Hey, the computer said such and such!"), but those
answers will be of questionable value unless the predictors have very
strong predictive power.

Note that setting utility values for "false positive," "false negative"
and so on does not solve the problem.  One still needs to factor in the
class probabilities in order to maximize expected utility.

Once again, **balancing the data will not help.**

Frank Harrell 
[says it well](https://www.fharrell.com/post/classification/):

## Summary

- There's really no need to artificially balance your data, and doing so
  could be harmful.

- Please don't throw away data.

- Conversely, creating extra data by up-sampling distorts the analysis
  and may undermine our predictive power.

- If your data is "naturally" unbalanced, meaning it reflects population
  structure as in the credit card fraud example, don't artificially
force balance.  Instead, choose a threshhold for conditional
probabilities, and flag new cases that exceed it.

- If your data is unrealistically balanced, as in the letters example,
  and the true unconditional class probabilities are known, use the
adjustment formula to convert the reported unconditional probabilities to
realistic ones, and classify using them.

- If your data is unrealistically balanced but the true unconditional
  class probabilities are unknown, recognize that your ML analysis may
have only a very restricted interpretation and value.

## Appendix: derivation of the adjustment formula

(For ease of notation etc., no distinction will be made here between
sample and population quantities.)

Say there are two classes, labeled 1 and 0.  Let Y denote the label and
X denote the features, and say we have a new case with X = t.  Then

P(Y = 1 | X = t) = p f<sub>1</sub>(t) / [p f<sub>1</sub>t) + (1-p)
f<sub>0</sub>(t)]  
<br>
(Eqn. 1)

where p is P(Y = 1), the unconditional probability of Class 1, and
f<sub>i</sub>(t) is the conditional density of X within Class i.
(If X is a discete random variable, substitute a probability for f.)

Rewrite the above as

P(Y = 1 | X = t) = 1 / [1 + {(1-p)/p} f<sub>0</sub>(t) / f<sub>1</sub>(t)]
<br>
(Eqn. 2)

Now suppose the analyst artificially changes the class counts in the
data (or, as in the letters example, the data is artificially sampled by
design), with proportions q and 1-q for the two classes.  In the case of
artificially equalizing the class proportions, we have q = 0.5.  Then
the above becomes, in the eyes of your ML algorithm,

P(Y = 1 | X = t) = 1 / [1 + {(1-q)/q} f<sub>0</sub>(t) / f<sub>1</sub>(t)]
<br>
(Eqn. 3)

As noted earlier, what the ML algorithm is computing, directly or
indirectly, is P(Y = 1 | X = t).  Moreover, as also noted earlier, even
`caret` and `mlr3` do make these quantities available for the various t,
so we can solve for f<sub>0</sub>(t) / f<sub>1</sub>(t):

f<sub>0</sub>(t) / f<sub>1</sub>(t) = (g - 1) q/(1-q)  
<br>
(Eqn. 4)

where

g = 1 / P(Y = 1 | X = t)

We can now substitute in (Eqn. 2) from (Eqn. 4) to get the proper
conditional probability.

The general m-class case. classes 0,1,...,m-1, actually reduces to the
2-class case, because 

P(Y = i | X = t)

can be viewed as the conditional probability of class i vs. all other
classes.

## Appendix:  What is really happening if you use equal class probabilities?

Say we have balanced data, so the q<sub>i</sub> = 1/m for each i.  Then
in predicting the class of a new case having X = t, Equation 1 becomes

P(Y = i | X = t) = f<sub>i</sub>(t) / 
[
&Sigma;<sub>j</sub> 
f<sub>j</sub>t) 
]

for i = 0,1,...,m-1, since all the 1/m factors cancel.

This shows that our guessed class is

j = arg max<sub>i</sub> f<sub>i</sub>(t)

In other words, you are in effect asking, "Within which class j would our
data X = t be most likely?"  That is, we are maximizing (say in the discrete
case)

P(X = t | Y = j)

over j. That's completely different from the question we really are
interested in, "Which class j is most likely, given X = t?", i.e.
maximizing

P(Y = j | X = t )
  
But it does show that if we artificially equalize the class sizes, we
are finding the Maximum Likelihood Estimate of j, **if the p<sub>i</sub>
are unknown.**

If we really don't know the true class probabilities p<sub>i</sub>, and
artificially equalize the class sizes, we are at least getting a kind of MLE.
However, what then is the practical meaning?  Unless you are a
subjective Bayesian (I am not), setting a flat prior, there is not much
here.
